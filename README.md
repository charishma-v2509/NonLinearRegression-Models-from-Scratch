# NonLinearRegression-Models-from-Scratch
<p>
This project implements several core regression models using pure Python without any external libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, or scikit-learn. These models are essential in understanding the mathematical foundations of machine learning and statistics.
</p>

<h2>Implemented Models</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Polynomial Regression:</strong> Fits a polynomial curve to the data for more complex relationships.</li>
  <li><strong>Power Model:</strong> Models relationships where the dependent variable varies as a power of the independent variable.</li>
  <li><strong>Saturation Growth Model:</strong> Represents growth that increases rapidly at first and then plateaus.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Run</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository:
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/charishma-v2509/NonLinearRegression-Models-from-Sratch.git</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Navigate to the project folder and run any model script:
    <pre><code>python linear_regression.py</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Understand the math behind various regression techniques.</li>
  <li>Learn to implement algorithms without using third-party libraries.</li>
  <li>Gain better control over model internals and numerical computations.</li>
</ul>
